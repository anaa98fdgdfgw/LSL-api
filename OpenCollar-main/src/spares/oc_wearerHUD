This script can be dropped into an object worn as a HUD attachment and will trigger
the OpenCollar menu for the wearer's own collar, using the OpenCollar interface channel
menuto function. At some point we may expand interface channel functionality (or rather
revert the removal of this) and make this a more general purpose wearer hud.
