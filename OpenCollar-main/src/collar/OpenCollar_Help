==========
1. The Very Basics
==========

Making use of the many, many features in your collar can be done by touching your neck, by touching your collar directly, by using a remote or with individual chat commands. Touching the collar will bring up a menu, through which you can control the collar wearer's actions in a wide variety of ways. You can issue a great many commands using chat shortcuts, or if you are having trouble clicking a collar, you can summon a wearer's collar menu up with the chat command '/1 [prefix] menu' (see below)

===========
2. Owners & Access
============

One of the key concepts of Opencollar is *permissions*. Not everyone can access your collar by default, as access is controlled by permission levels. When you first wear a collar, the only person able to do anything with it is you. By changing access, either by granting permissions to single avatars or by using the GROUP or PUBLIC access modes, you can give permissions to other people. The maximum lever is OWNER. If someone has OWNER permission on your collar, they can access every feature and setting of the collar, and can do things that cannot be overridden by people with a lower level of permission (including the wearer!).

The levels of permission are as follows:
OWNER - Someone with Owner access has access to every function of your collar.
TRUSTED - Someone with Trusted access can access most things in your collar, but generally can't change settings. They cannot override certain things that have been set by an owner. For example, a Trusted access user cannot unleash the collar wearer if they have been leashed by an owner.
GROUP - When you have group mode active, people who have the same group active may access the general functions (not settings) of your collar. 
PUBLIC - when your collar is set to public mode, anyone can access your collar

BLACKLIST - your collar can maintain a blacklist of users who are never allowed to use your collar. Even if you have public access switched on, a person on your blacklist will not be able to use any feature of your collar.


===============
3. Using Chat Commands
===============

So that the collar knows who you intend on a chat command, commands are always issued with a prefix based on the collar wearer's name. They can be spoken in local chat, or on channel 1 (/1 [prefix] [command]) to keep them private and to avoid  the additional lag caused by using the public channel. 

Your [prefix] are the first two letters of your username

    Athaliah Opus's prefix is: at
    nirea's prefix is: ni
    Iala (jwenting)'s prefix is: jw

Your prefix is used to issue commands in the Nearby Chat or channel 1.

    [prefix] menu or /1 [prefix] menu
    [prefix] kneel or /1 [prefix] kneel
    [prefix] stop or /1 [prefix] stop

If you don’t like your prefix, you can change it. Only an owner can change the prefix, and the wearer if there is no owner set.

    sr prefix ss
    wr prefix we
    js prefix sex

There are two special prefixes. * issues commands to everyone nearby and # issues commands to everyone except yourself.

    * grab
    # grab

If you don’t like channel 1 set a different channel.

    [prefix] channel 2
    [prefix] channel 3
    [prefix] channel 69
    [prefix] channel 9001

If you are considerate about lag, you can also turn off the Nearby Chat listener. Toggle 'Listen 0' in the Settings menu.  WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND DOING THIS, it will make a collar significantly less laggy!

=========
4. Safewords:
=========

Your collar also has a safeword which you simply type in the nearby chat. This will lift all RLV restrictions, unpose and unleash you. 
It will also send your Owner a message to check for your well being. RED in capital letters is the default safeword.

    RED
    /1RED
    ((RED))

If that’s too hard to remember you can easily change it.   

    [prefix] safeword Purple

==========
5. MENUS
==========

The Collar's main menu looks like this:

[    □ Lock    ]   [   Leash   ]   [   Addons    ]
[ Animations ]   [    RLV     ]   [     Apps      ]
[    Access    ]   [ Settings ]   [Help/About]

LOCK: This button locks or unlocks the collar. "□ Lock" means the collar us unlocked, while "▣ Lock" means it's locked. We use these check boxes in a number of places to show when an option has been selected. Only owners and wearer can lock a collar; only an owner can unlock it.

Each of the other buttons will open a submenu, and many of those will have other submenus beneath them, exposing more options below.

LEASH: Allows for the wearer to be leashed. A leash can be held by another user and the leashed collar wearer will be forced to follow them around when they walk. Alternatively a leash can be tied to an object, and the collar wearer will not be able to roam further than the length of the leash. 

ADDONS: This menu allows access to separate attachments that are interfacing with the collar to share data with it. For example, OpenCollar makes a set of OpenCollar cuffs which communicate with the collar, using the collar's lists of owners etc. for access. If you are wearing those add-on cuffs, you'll find a menu for them in here.

ANIMATIONS: The collar can be used to pose the collar wearer in a range of animations

RLV: This contains submenus that deal with many viewer controlled RLV features. For example in here you'll find options for changing outfits and accessing the #RLV folders to attach or remove their contents, for setting restrictions on the wearer, and controlling exceptions for the people on the collar's access list (such as force teleport), and for forcing the wearer to sit on nearby furniture, or stand up

APPS: This menu contains submenus for all installed apps, optional functions that allow more things to be done with a collar. Common apps include bookmarks (teleporting the wearer to predetermined locations), timer (setting a timer to lock or unlock the collar wearer after a fixed time), Titler (setting a text title over the wearer's head), Themes (some collars have a themes menu for changing different looks and Capture (short-term capture play).

ACCESS: For controlling who has access to a collar, adding or removing people from Owner, Blacklist or Trusted, for switching group or public mode etc.

SETTINGS: Access to some of the core global settings of the collar functioning, and for advanced users access to an EDITOR to allow editing internal settings directly.

HELP/ABOUT: Information about the collar such as where to find help, what the chat command prefix and channels are, and what the safeword is. This menu will also tell you if there's an update available. See below for more!


=================
6. UPDATING YOUR COLLAR
=================

Looking inside the Help/About menu will show you the current version of your collar, and inform you if there is an update available. WE ALWAYS RECOMMEND YOU UPDATE TO THE LATEST VERSION OF OPENCOLLAR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

If there is an updater, get yourself a copy either by looking in OpenCollar group notices and grabbing the update/built notecard, or visit the OpenCollar Headquarters at K-Bar West (landmark at the top of the page). So long as your collar is reasonably recent, you can simply rez the updater and click the update button in your collar's Help/About menu. The update process will take a couple of minutes. Please keep an eye on your local chat and wait for messages that tell you that the update process has completed AND that your collar has finished rebooting and is ready for use.

If you want to update a collar that's very old, or has used a different brand of collar scripts, or indeed you want to turn an unscripted necklace or similar into a collar, the notecard in your group notices provides everything you need to do that, with complete instructions.


 
===============
Appendix: List of Chat Commands
===============

Here is an ALMOST complete list of chat commands that can be used either because you prefer to do things with chat commands than clicking menus, or because you need a chat command to set a custom command in the titler or similar, or because you want to create a gesture as a shortcut, or simply because it can be quicker and easier than clicking a collar and going through the menus.

To use any of these commands in chat or in a gesture, determine the collar wearer's prefix (see above) and say the command below in local chat, with channel and prefix in front of it.

----------
Example
----------
The main menu command is "menu".
If the collar wearer's user name is "Nirea Resident" then her default prefix is "ni".
The normal private channel is 1.
Therefore the command to get Nirea's menu would be:

"/1 ni menu"

If you don't want to use the channel you can say it in local chat too, as long as the wearer has not disabled channel 0.

"ni menu"
